# Mind maps
Using graphviz library to create graphs and mind maps.
I created this project because I'm annoyed of mind maps softwares and i prefer to write text
and render graphs that are uglier but in more functional way. 



# Installation
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install graphviz
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
